# 🌐 My Third Website

![demoimg](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/608c9b6e-8176-48ef-99b9-beef73c00d28)

It’s not your typical simple website — it’s a bit **unique**, and you’ll know exactly what I mean once you open it. 😉  
I’ve added various **interactive animations** to make the experience fun and engaging. For example, a **white ball follows your cursor** throughout the site, and when you hover over the **main heading on the landing page**, you’ll see a **cool video running through transparent text**. And that’s just the beginning — there’s a lot more to explore! 😁  

This website is built using **HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, GSAP, and Shery.js**, blending smooth animations with modern interactivity for a cool, dynamic experience.

- **CSS3** – For styling, responsiveness, and creative animations  
- **JavaScript (Vanilla JS)** – To add interactivity and logic  
- **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)** – For smooth, professional-grade animations and transitions  
- **Shery.js** – For advanced interactive effects and cool visual elements

## 🚀 What's Next / Future Improvements

This project is still evolving, and I plan to add more exciting features and polish it further. Some upcoming improvements include:

- 🖼️ Adding more creative animations and interactive sections  
- 📱 Making the website fully **responsive** (currently it’s not mobile-friendly, so open it on your phone at your own risk 😅)  
- ⚡ Optimizing performance for smoother experience across all devices  
- 🏎️ Improving loading speed and reducing animation lag  
- 🔧 Refactoring code for better scalability and maintainability  
- 🌍 Deploying with a live link so everyone can explore it directly  

> ⚠️ Note: Sometimes I’ve noticed a **slight laggy experience** while browsing the website. I’m still investigating whether this is due to my system or something in the animation scripts. Feedback from others would be super helpful!
